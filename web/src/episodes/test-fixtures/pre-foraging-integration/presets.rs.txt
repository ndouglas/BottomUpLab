The mountains stay in sight of most sites and refill fast, so a rememberer should gain little. Measured (20 seeds, ticks 200–500): rememberers lose instead. They hold a median 324 sugar against the others' 438 (an advantage of −113), within 10 % of the others in only 2 of 20 seeds. Two likely causes. First, rule M prices no travel: it values a site by its sugar alone, so a far remembered site believed full beats a near one. Under the utility mind with travel 0.5 (memory as here), the advantage rises by a median 119, higher in every seed, to about neutral: +7.4 (IQR −18 to +37), rememberers wealthier in only 10 of 20 seeds. But the share of rememberers' choices aimed at a remembered site falls from 0.68 to 0.10, and across the arms the loss tracks how often memory is used (projection uses it about twice as often as recall, 0.68 against 0.34, and loses more). So pricing travel removes the loss, largely by using memory less; no gain was shown. Second, projection ignores competitors who harvest a site first: under recall (believing a site holds what it held when seen) the advantage is −34, and projection is worse than recall in every seed, with a larger belief error (2.67 against 2.46 sugar; measured only on the targets chosen, the ones believed best, so biased by that selection). Most choices of a remembered site out of sight find less there than believed under either belief (93 % under project, 95 % under recall). Memory for everyone (share 1) lowers the population to 154 from walking's 181 (mean over ticks 300–500), in every seed, so memory doesn't restore the capacity walking lost. Across spans (the mem-span sweeps) the advantage is negative at every span and growback rate, so the \"best\" span is only the least-harmful one; under recall it's 10 ticks at growback 1, the shortest span tested (IQR 10–10), against 25 at 0.25 and 0.5.

Few foragers, patches in sight and a travel cost is the marginal value theorem's setting: when to leave a patch that's still yielding. Measured (20 seeds, ticks 1–1000): under this mind, foragers who find a patch never leave it. A patch here takes in far more than one agent eats, so no agent ever departs (0 departures over all 20 seeds) and a median 5 of the 10 are alive at tick 1000, each settled on a patch; the rest likely start with no sugar in sight and stand still until they starve. Depleting patches don't help: with radius 2 and growback 0.05 (0.45 sugar a tick per patch), nobody is alive after tick 200 with 10 agents; with 3, nobody is alive at tick 1000 and only 3 departures happen across 20 seeds. So the theorem's decision, leaving when a patch's intake falls to the habitat's average, is untestable here. Likely reason: rule M and the utility mind compare the values of sites, not rates of intake, and hold no estimate of the habitat's average rate; and with sight only along rows and columns, a forager that has emptied a patch often has no other patch in sight.

            "The marginal value theorem's world, for a planner: 3 agents (metabolism 1, endowment 50, vision 1–6) on a 60 × 60 torus with nine equal patches (peaks of radius 3, height 4, 25 sites each) on a square lattice of spacing 20, growback 0.02. They walk, and plan with GOAP: each tick an agent without a plan searches for the fastest sequence of harvests, among the 8 sites it knows with the most sugar per tick of walking (value ÷ (distance + 1)), that gathers 10 ticks of food, pricing each walk by its length. Every agent remembers (span 1 000, share 1) and starts knowing the whole map, as the theorem's ideal forager does. The balance is set so a patch runs out under one forager (it takes in 0.5 sugar a tick against a forager's 1) while all nine patches together take in 1.5 times what the population eats (4.5 against 3). Measured (20 seeds, ticks 1–1000, the same world at spacings 12, 16, 20 and 24): longer travel, longer stays, as Charnov's theorem predicts. The fitted slope of mean patch residence on spacing is positive in every seed (a median 0.41 ticks per unit of spacing), though the median residence (18.6, 22.6, 25.7 and 22.8 ticks) dips between spacings 20 and 24, where a median 1 of the 3 agents is alive at tick 1000 at both. Survival falls with spacing (a median 3, 2, 1 and 1 alive), so the longest spacings rest on fewer foragers. At spacing 20, 28 of the 60 agents are alive at tick 1000. By the literal measure, agents overstay at a median 57 % of departures (above half in 18 of 20 seeds): their last tick in the patch gathers less than their average so far. That last tick is likely often a step walking out: counting only the last in-patch tick on which an agent landed on a plan target, the share is 30 % at spacing 20, above half in no seed (1 % of departures dropped as all transit). Unlike Constantino and Daw's people, they overstay less as travel grows (61 % at spacing 12, 46 % at 24 by the literal measure; 33 % and 20 % without transit). Rule M with the same knowledge (the map, memory) leaves after about 5 ticks at every spacing, its stays shorten as spacing grows in every seed, and at spacings 16 to 24 a median 0 of its 3 agents is alive at tick 1000. The planner plans afresh on 12 % of agent-ticks and falls back on under 1 %. With the value shortlist (the spec's first design: the 8 best known sites by value alone), stays shorten with spacing in every seed and only 4 of 60 are alive at tick 1000 at spacing 20; likely because ranking by value alone leaves only far patch centers to plan over.",

Each keeps ρ, its delivered sugar per tick over its trips; in a patch it stays while the best site within one step yields at least ρ (and it isn't full, or low on food for the walk home), then walks home, delivers and leaves again, keeping enough in hand for the walk out and back. They know the whole map, carry loads of at most 320 and burn 1 a tick. central-far is the same world with homes 20 columns away. Measured (20 seeds, ticks 1–1000): every agent lives; a trip gathers a mean 128 sugar and brings 84 home, having eaten the rest on the way. 64 % of trips end when no site nearby yields ρ, and 36 % with a full load. On 40 % of trips the agent turns home on its first tick deciding in the patch: a delivery lifts ρ by about 0.05 × the load (4.1 here), as much as the best site yields, and ρ hasn't decayed much by the time it gets back (a median 2.4 on arrival). Loads rise with the patches' distance from home, as central-place theory predicts: a mean 68 per trip at 4 columns, 84 at 8, 100 at 12, 107 at 16, 108 at 20 and 110 at 24, rising in all 20 seeds. ρ on arrival is lower after a longer walk (0.73 at 20 columns), likely a contributor, not isolated; and far out the carrying limit sets the loads (53 % of trips end full at 20 columns). Lima's prediction, that a near and a far patch in one habitat give the same load, fails as it was set out: sorting trips by the patch that gave most of the load, far trips bring home 120 and near ones 54, and the carrying limit ends 75 % of those far trips. But the near patch lay on the way to the far one, and agents harvest where they step. Sorted by where the agent was headed, the loads are 75 far and 71 near; with ρ held fixed, 82 and 85, though fewer agents live (88 of 100 at tick 1000, against 97 with ρ learned). With the far patch on the other side of home, so no trip crosses the other patch, they are 83 and 73, and with ρ held fixed there, 100 and 74 (80 of 100 alive, against 99). There the far patch holds more sugar when an agent arrives (37.5 against 33.6): an agent heads for the far patch only when a site there is strictly richer than every near one (ties go to the nearer), likely part of why; but that 12 % difference in standing sugar only partly explains a 35 % difference in loads, and the rest isn't isolated.

A delivery lifts ρ by about 0.05 × the load (5.9 here), above the most any site yields (4), so the next trip turns back at once; with little delivered, ρ likely decays and the trip after fills up.

            "watch-scroungers-only's world (theft-winter's winter, no stumbling on caches, half the agents watchers who are also cheaters, dealt by the same id rule so at half each they are the same agents) with two changes. A scrounger holding a fresh memory of a cache it saw buried considers only those caches and staying put, and harvests no site on any tick it holds one and doesn't raid, as a pure scrounger gives up foraging for its own food. And loot is eaten on the spot, not carried, so a scrounger's raid never fills its carrying limit. The rest bury half their surplus where they stand and never watch. An agent who watches and sees another bury (the site on one of the four lattice lines from it, within its vision and not behind an opaque wall) remembers the cache for 7 ticks; a scrounger raids a remembered cache on arriving whatever the site would give, since it would not harvest the site anyway, and eats what it takes of the first remembered cache still there (or finds them all gone). An owner digging its own cache comes first. Measured (ticks 1–200; scrounger shares 0.1 to 0.9 over seeds 1–60, the rest seeds 1–20): forgoing doesn't pay. At half, the scroungers' fitness, the share of ticks 1–200 a founder is alive, is 0.784 against the hoarders' 0.893; 53 % of them survive the first winter against 55 % (per founder), so those that die, die sooner. Their shortfall grows as they become common, as Barnard and Sibly's producer–scrounger game has it (per-seed slope on the share −0.20, 95 % interval −0.23 to −0.17, below 0 in 59 of 60 seeds), from 0.04 at a share of 0.1 up to 0.23 at 0.8 (0.17 at 0.9; medians). But no stable mix forms: the scroungers are ahead at a share of 0.1 in only 13 of 60 seeds, and the median scrounger trails at every share. Never caching costs them a little on its own: in the same worlds with watching off they trail by about 0.02 at every share (a median 0.015 at a share of 0.1; at half, fitness 0.888 against 0.911 and 48 % against 70 % surviving the first winter). Watching adds the rest: per seed, the shortfall with watching less that without is a median 0.034 at a share of 0.1 (in 47 of 60 seeds) and 0.20 at 0.8, so the shortfall when rare is mostly scrounging's, and its growth with share entirely so. Within scrounging, forgoing is the cost: letting scroungers harvest too (`scrounge: harvest`) raises their fitness by 0.13 (in all 20 seeds), above the hoarders'. With a memory of 1 or 2 ticks instead of 7, their shortfall shrinks as they become common instead.",

A stranger arriving on a site finds each cache there with chance 0.02, not 0.25. And an owner digs up one of its caches whenever it holds less than its whole reserve of 20 ticks' food, not half of it. This is item 4 of the calibration list for Andersson and Krebs's claim under watching: the first world on the list where, without watching, owners dig back more of their caches' ended sugar than thieves take (p_s > p_o) in at least 16 of 20 seeds. It did so in all 20, and the items before it in 7, 0 and 0. An agent who watches and sees another bury (the site on one of the four lattice lines from it, within its vision and not behind an opaque wall) remembers the cache for 7 ticks; while it remembers one it may walk there, and on arriving it raids only if it remembers at least as much sugar there as the site would give it, taking what it can carry of the first remembered cache still there (or finding them all gone); otherwise it harvests as usual and keeps the memory. An owner digging its own cache comes first. Measured (20 seeds, ticks 1–200): watching flips Andersson and Krebs's condition. Without watching, owners dig back 78 % of their ended caches' sugar and thieves take 22 % (p_s ÷ p_o 3.6); with everyone watching, 39 % and 59 % (0.67), below 1 in all 20 seeds. It flips with a memory of 3, 7 or 13 ticks, but not of 1 or 2 (1.72 and 1.10). Fitness hardly follows. The hoarders' fitness, the share of ticks 1–200 a founder is alive, falls from 0.933 to 0.916 and the cheaters' rises from 0.938 to 0.943, so the hoarders' shortfall grows by 0.023 (in all 20 seeds); but across watching off and memories of 1, 3, 7 and 13 ticks the sign of their advantage matches the condition's in only 62 of 100 runs. Survival moves more: 67 % of the hoarders survive the first winter against 76 % of the cheaters (per founder), where without watching it is 87 % against 75 %. Watching only by the cheaters costs the hoarders 0.012 of advantage (95 % interval 0.008 to 0.017), well under the 0.05 the claim asked for; watching only by the hoarders changes their own fitness by no detectable amount (0.003 lower, interval −0.002 to 0.007).",
