# Papers: what we have reproduced and what is next

The playground reproduces published agent-based models from their stated rules, with each
ambiguity or departure as a named switch, and reports where a paper's claims do not reproduce
(see the survey, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-model-survey-design.md`). This file tracks the
source papers: which milestone used each, which critiques we have, and the queue.

The [research method](research-method.md) defines the faithful, charitable and scientific-evaluation sequence, with scientific value as the ultimate objective. Source versions, interpretations and counterfactuals remain distinct throughout.

The [reproducibility register](reproducibility.md) maintains claim-level discrepancies, source
identity and measurement gaps, corrected issues and concrete next actions across the completed
catalog and Minds programme. It keeps conditional mismatches separate from unmeasured leads.

The [2026-10-06 Minds P3 findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-minds-protection-findings.md)
report the complete registered re-caching mechanism campaign (7,680 episodes), independently
reviewed; publication remains pending. Corvid sources motivate its qualitative interventions; this is our own experiment,
not a numerical reproduction of a source paper. Costs, renewed observation, cue mismatch and
reflected recovery geometry remain visible in all registered comparisons.

**Where the files are.** Local copies live in `papers/<topic>/`, which is gitignored: they are
personal copies, never committed or redistributed. File names are
`<authors>-<year>[-<venue>]-<short-title>.<pdf|html>`. A paper marked *not in `papers/`* was
read online or from another copy; add it when found. Scanned PDFs (no text layer) are marked
*scan*: read them page by page as images (`pdftoppm -r 110 -png`).

## Architecture and underworld research

The [cultures, construction and underworlds programme](studies/2026-10-03-cultures-construction-and-underworlds.md)
preserves the long-term campaign outline and selects collective burrow construction for first
refinement. These books are research/design sources, not reproduced models or evidence that
speculative cultural combinations are validated.

Local copies collected on 2026-10-03 from the user's supplied library:

| Source | Local file under `papers/` | Inspection status |
|---|---|---|
| Christopher Alexander, *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* (1964; supplied copy includes the 1971 paperback preface) | `architecture/alexander-1964-notes-on-the-synthesis-of-form.pdf` | Paperback preface and selected requirements/decomposition sections inspected; not reviewed in full |
| Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein, with collaborators, *A Pattern Language* (1977) | `architecture/alexander-ishikawa-silverstein-et-al-1977-a-pattern-language.pdf` | Collected; not reviewed in full |
| Christopher Alexander, *The Timeless Way of Building* (1979) | `architecture/alexander-1979-the-timeless-way-of-building.pdf` | Collected; not reviewed in full |

The copies were verified byte-for-byte with SHA-256 against the originals. Exact source paths,
destination paths, sizes, page counts and hashes are retained locally in
`papers/architecture/alexander-local-provenance.json`. The PDFs and local provenance remain
gitignored under the existing personal-library convention.

The first burrow branch has an [initial excavation reading](studies/2026-10-03-burrow-excavation-reading.md)
and [proposed lab design](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-burrow-1-excavation-design.md).
Pielström and Roces (2013), PLOS ONE e57040, is the selected transport/cue anchor; Green et al.
(2017), Proceedings B 20162730, and Prasath et al. (version of record 2023), eLife 79638, are
alternative/later leads. These articles were accessed online and are not yet copied into `papers/`.

The [foraging/construction source audit](studies/2026-10-04-foraging-construction-reading.md)
adds Hecker and Moses (2015), *Beyond pheromones*, as a controller-reference anchor. Its
methods/pseudocode were inspected; a personal copy is at
`papers/foraging/hecker-moses-2015-beyond-pheromones.pdf` with a local hash/provenance record.
It has not been reproduced here. Michael et al. (2023), *Finding shortcuts through collective
tunnel excavations in a subterranean termite*, is a later biological comparison target,
inspected through accessible indexed methods/discussion and not copied locally. The
[approved sequence and first-increment spec](superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-foraging-construction-design.md)
record the next review gate. The [F1 reference guide](foraging.md) documents implemented and independently reviewed rules, merged into `main` at `5819a04`; scientific execution remains separate.

| 10 | `anasazi` | Janssen 2009 JASSS 12(4) 13 and the CoMSES data (*not in `papers/`*); Axtell et al. 2002 PNAS (*not in `papers/`*) | the documented model does not reproduce the published fit |
| 11 | `civil` | Epstein 2002 PNAS 99 (*not in `papers/`*) | the stated arrest rule gives no rebellion; only NetLogo's rounding reproduces Model I |
| 12 | `tags` | `tags/riolo-cohen-axelrod-2001-nature-cooperation-without-reciprocity.pdf`; Edmonds & Hales 2003, Roberts & Sherratt 2002 (*not in `papers/`*) | the tables need p. 442's tie rule (the current agent wins), not a coin flip |
| 13 | `spatial` | `spatial-games/nowak-may-1992-…` (*scan*), `huberman-glance-1993-…`, `nowak-bonhoeffer-may-1994-…` | Huberman & Glance's one-defector takeover reproduces in their regime (1.8 < b < 2); as NBM94 showed, not below it |
| 14 | `culture` | `culture/axelrod-1997-jcr-dissemination-of-culture.pdf` (*scan*); `culture/axtell-axelrod-epstein-cohen-1996-cmot-aligning-simulation-models.pdf` | the docking reproduces, including the mobility experiment's single culture on any sugar mountain broad or tall enough (its size is unstated; narrow, low ones leave many cultures); the sample setup runs higher (4.33 regions against 3.2) but his samples are within sampling error of it |
| 15 | `classes` | `classes/axtell-epstein-young-2000-…`, `classes/poza-et-al-2011-…` | classes never emerge under AEY's rule at their parameters |
| 16 | `ethno` | `ethnocentrism/hammond-axelrod-2006-jcr-evolution-of-ethnocentrism.pdf` | the appendix's 5 % mutation is a slip; neither doubled-cost figure (56 % seeing, 14 % blind) reproduces |
| 17 | `opinions` | `bounded-confidence/hegselmann-krause-2002-…`; `bounded-confidence/lorenz-2006-jasss-consensus-strikes-back.html` | Fig. 2b's two camps come up in about a third of runs (most keep a middle camp, as the paper's own Fig. 3 shows); the lattice claim holds |
| 18 | `structure` | `social-structure/cohen-riolo-axelrod-2001-role-of-social-structure.pdf` | reproduces closely; the high-cooperation threshold 2.3 is implied (p. 20), not defined; §2's looser noise reading overshoots Table 2 and narrows FRNE's edge over 2DK |
| 19 | `dpd` | `demographic-pd/epstein-1998-zones-of-cooperation-in-demographic-pd.pdf` (the working paper), `demographic-pd/epstein-2006-generative-social-science.pdf` (ch. 9: the published rule, Tables 9.1 and 9.3), `demographic-pd/radax-rengs-2009-mpra-replication-of-the-demographic-prisoners-dilemma.pdf` (published as JASSS 13(4) 1, 2010) | Tables 1 and 2 do not reproduce under the published rule; only unstated readings (founders with no wealth, the working paper's rule) come close; the metabolism "equivalence" holds only per game |
| 20 | `norms` | `norms/axelrod-1986-apsr-evolutionary-approach-to-norms.pdf`, `norms/galan-izquierdo-2005-jasss-appearances-can-be-deceiving.html` | Axelrod's 100-generation results reproduce; under G&I's tie reading metanorms usually collapse by 10⁶ (18 of 20), under Axelrod's words they mostly hold (14 of 20); under his dominance rule (only the other group touched) metanorms keep the weak group from being bold more easily than the strong, as he says, but without them the weak group ends bold in only about half the runs |
| 21 | `image` | `image-scoring/nowak-sigmund-1998-iiasa-indirect-reciprocity-by-image-scoring.pdf` (with NS98b's draft), `image-scoring/leimar-hammerstein-2001-prsb-cooperation-through-indirect-reciprocity.pdf`; Panchanathan & Boyd 2003, Lotem, Fishman & Stone 1999, Ohtsuki & Iwasa 2006 and FAIR23's `imagescore.nlogo` (*not in `papers/`*) | the universal constant reproduces to every digit; Fig. 1's k = 0 wins 1 run in 5; two interactions per lifetime do not suffice; LH01's island model does not undo image scoring |
| 22 | `agreement` | `bounded-confidence/deffuant-neau-amblard-weisbuch-2000-acs-mixing-beliefs.pdf`, `bounded-confidence/deffuant-amblard-weisbuch-faure-2002-jasss-how-can-extremism-prevail.html`, `bounded-confidence/amblard-deffuant-2004-network-topology-and-extremism.pdf`, `bounded-confidence/weisbuch-2003-bounded-confidence-and-social-networks.pdf`; the replication and reply `bounded-confidence/meadows-cliff-2012-jasss-reexamining-the-relative-agreement-model.html`, `bounded-confidence/deffuant-amblard-weisbuch-2013-jasss-meadows-and-cliff-are-wrong.html` | the reply’s two adjustments recover frequent single extremes; the frequency shrinks at measured population settings but survives at low extremist shares; published examples are assessed as examples, with finite-sample limits; the printed BC window misses the tested Fig. 20 band; sparse-network classifications depend on an unstated cutoff |
| 23 | `farol` | `el-farol/arthur-1994-aer-inductive-reasoning-and-bounded-rationality.pdf`, `el-farol/challet-zhang-1997-emergence-of-cooperation-minority-game.pdf`; follow-ups `el-farol/savit-manuca-riolo-1999-prl-adaptive-competition-market-efficiency-phase-transitions.pdf`, `el-farol/challet-zhang-1998-physica-a-on-the-minority-game-analytical-and-numerical.pdf`, `el-farol/challet-marsili-ottino-2004-physica-a-shedding-light-on-el-farol.pdf` | Arthur-inspired mean near 60, elevated variance and negative lag-1 correlation under stated library/scoring/tie choices; qualitative memory transition; Fig. 4 shape and Fig. 10 population purity are unresolved by the survey proxies; CMO binary checks use a step-payoff variant |
| 24 | `ants` | `ants/kirman-1993-qje-ants-rationality-and-recruitment.pdf`; the critique `ants/alfarano-milakovic-2007-warwick-wp-should-network-structure-matter.pdf` (published as JEDC 33(1), 2009) | exact beta-binomial recruitment reproduces asymmetry and switches; base stationary modes do not select 80–20, while our Becker-style formula has modes 18/82; Fig. IIb's near-half average is compatible with some finite records; herding weakens with N; AM's network results depend on the update rule, and our ring shortfall is conditional on N (Fig. 3 omits it) |
| 25 | `thresholds` | `thresholds/granovetter-1978-ajs-threshold-models-of-collective-behavior.pdf` (*scan*, read by OCR); the follow-up `thresholds/watts-2002-pnas-simple-model-of-global-cascades-on-random-networks.pdf` (from the Internet Archive's copy of PNAS) | exact crowds and Figure 2's continuous jump reproduce; finite crowds are separate realizations and city sampling confirms the paper's instability argument; Figure 3's upper-critical frequency is unresolved, with a caption/axis size conflict; Figure 4a compares cascade regions and needs a normal-tail convention; Figure 4b's literal degree family cannot span its plotted means; hub advantage persists at a rare finite-network point, while the asymptotic dense-regime claim remains unresolved |
| 26 | `retirement` | `retirement/axtell-epstein-1999-coordination-in-transient-social-networks-retirement.pdf`; the revised text `demographic-pd/epstein-2006-generative-social-science.pdf` (ch. 7) | source-specific AE/GSS policy setups; first95 is an operational proxy, not an age norm; qualitative trajectory and sensitivity trends, both groups converge as the rational group slows; denominator and criticality observations remain reconstruction-dependent; policy has censoring and weak persistence |
| 27 | `punishment` | `punishment/boyd-gintis-bowles-richerson-2003-pnas-altruistic-punishment.pdf`; the critique `punishment/cooney-2024-arxiv-altruistic-punishment-pde-multilevel-selection.pdf` (published in *Bull. Math. Biol.* 2025); Janssen's NetLogo replication `punishment/janssen-comses-2223-netlogo/` (GPL-3.0: readings only) | the shapes hold but not the reach; the baseline is unstated and the caption contradicts the legend; the figures fit twice the stated conflict rate (14 of 14 curves; the text's rate 2); continuous traits are not similar; Cooney's dip appears under every victory rule |
| 28 | `zi` | `zi-traders/gode-sunder-1993-jpe-zero-intelligence-traders.pdf` (*scan*, read by OCR); the critique `zi-traders/cliff-1997-hp-minimal-intelligence-agents-for-bargaining.pdf` (with its C source) | the five markets recovered from the figures (Table 2 pins four exactly); efficiencies and dispersions reproduce, but only with enough shouts — "30 seconds" is never translated; Cliff's predictions miss the box markets and his 233⅓ is not his formula's; ZIP converges; his code's momentum is not his text's |
| 29 | `bali` | `bali/lansing-kremer-1993-am-anthropologist-balinese-water-temples.pdf` (*scan*); the reanalysis `bali/janssen-2007-agricultural-systems-coordination-in-irrigation.pdf`; Janssen's CoMSES model 2221 for the watershed data (GPL-2.0, shipped as data in `data/bali/`) | imitation's rise and Table 1 reproduce; the temple resemblance is the pest network's own; the subaks settle harder and the paper's perturbed run never recovers; the scale of coordination moves the harvest by 1–7 %, depending on the reading of the subak–dam columns, never Janssen's +30 %, and the temple scale is never best; the two-node threshold holds exactly; his code's departures barely matter |
| 30 | `schelling`, `line` | `schelling/schelling-1971-jms-dynamic-models-of-segregation.pdf` (*scan*), `schelling/schelling-1969-aer-models-of-segregation.pdf`; for later, `schelling/zhang-2004-jms-…` and `schelling/bruch-mare-2008-…` | Schelling's own checkerboard and line; on the board his direction holds throughout, but his hand-worked boards sit at the segregated end of what his rules give (0.80 alike and 38 % unmixed, not Fig. 8's 90 % and two-thirds; ratio 3.6, not four to one; the 2:1 minority at 1.3); a halved minority on the line is no more segregated; 24 neighbors attenuate at a third but sort more at half; restricted travel leaves 6 % unsatisfied |
| 31 | `tipping` | `schelling/schelling-1971-jms-dynamic-models-of-segregation.pdf` (*scan*), pp. 167–186; `schelling/schelling-1969-aer-models-of-segregation.pdf` | Schelling's bounded neighborhood reproduces completely: the two one-color states of Fig. 18, the 80–80 mixture from over 40 %, more than 25 % to tip in, the 3.0 threshold, forty apiece, the minority that must be the more tolerant and the less tolerant two-thirds |
| 32 | `schelling`, `line` (variations) | `schelling/pancs-vriend-2007-jpube-spatial-proximity-model-revisited.pdf`, `schelling/gauvin-vannimenus-nadal-2009-epjb-phase-diagram.pdf`, `schelling/singh-vainchtein-weiss-2009-demres-parameters-scaling-aggregation.pdf`, `schelling/zhang-2004-jebo-residential-segregation-all-integrationist-world.pdf` | each under its authors' rules and with its own cluster count: Pancs & Vriend's 5 × 5 results, strict equilibria and ring reproduce, but not their footnote's spiked ≈ p100 (7.0 against 4.7), Gauvin et al.'s frozen, segregated and mixed phases and their 3/4, Singh et al.'s small city (2 clusters) against the big one (20 and 58); Gauvin et al.'s frozen line matches Table 1 within one step; Zhang's segregation from a checkerboard holds and his trades are exactly a conserved Ising model, but his Fig. 8 cutoff of 600 is the least possible, and read as his scaled potential it comes 400 times sooner, his transition sits near β ≈ 5, not 2, and eight neighbors are not twice as fast as four |
| 33 | `firms` | `firms/axtell-1999-emergence-of-firms.pdf`; the follow-up `firms/axtell-2013-lem-endogenous-dynamics-of-firms-and-labor.pdf` (his 2013 parameterization) | Table 1's §2 analytics reproduce exactly, but optimal group sizes miss his "under 10" by a hair; the 1999 base case gives µ ≈ 2.5, not 1.28, and firms living ~4 periods, not 23.4, under every reading; most §4 tables' directions hold, the friends and seniority tables reverse; three unstated details (where sticky effort applies, which way seniority pay runs, who covers a base-pay shortfall) decide whole tables; the 2013 parameterization gives Zipf's law, though the largest firm peaks at 3 000–5 800 of the 10 000 agents after the burn-in (5 seeds), though most of the time it stays under about 1 000 (median 780–955) |
| 34 | `collusion` | `ai-coordination/calvano-calzolari-denicolo-pastorello-2020-aer-ai-algorithmic-pricing-and-collusion.pdf` with its online appendix and replication package (MIT; the Fortran built here as the reference); the critics in `ai-coordination/`: Asker, Fershtman & Pakes 2021–22, Lambin 2024, Epivent & Lambin 2023, den Boer, Meylahn & Schinkel 2026, Waltman & Kaymak 2006–08 | the code's sessions reproduced period for period (100 of 100), Table I and Table A5 to the digit; the text's "more than 95 %" is 93.6 %; the described equilibrium holds in 0.2 % of sessions (the code's one-period test: 49.7 %); Fig. 4's deviation answers the wrong state; memoryless firms price higher (Δ 0.958), δ = 0 gives 0.212, increases are "punished" like cuts, synchronous learning halves Δ, re-paired firms earn 0.125; slower exploration and Lambin's Theorem 1 fail |
| 35 | `auctions` | `multi-agent-coordination/banchio-skrzypacz-2022-arxiv-ai-and-auction-design.pdf`; Banchio & Mantegazza 2023 and other follow-ups in [reading notes](superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-q-learning-auctions-reading-notes.md) | Baseline low first-price/high second-price bids and all-action feedback direction hold; Figure 5, downward, fringe and persistent criteria fail; patient three-bidder coverage is inconclusive; initialization matters ([findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-q-learning-auctions-findings.md)) |
| 36 | `polarity` | `geopolitics/cederman-1994-isq-emergent-polarity.pdf`; Cederman 1997 ch.4–5; Radax, Störmer/Köhler et al. and Duffy in [reading notes](superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-emergent-polarity-reading-notes.md) | Complete 572-arm/28,520-session reconstruction measured: 45 Compatible, 24 Incompatible, 3 Unresolved; Defense P2 aggregate: Fails; Alliance P3 aggregate: Fails; 239 invalid outcomes retained. Direct endpoint stock frequencies and Störmer 110-configuration scatter; approved corrections, including the per-period domestic decision repair, retain original verdicts and same-seed provenance ([findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-emergent-polarity-findings.md)); published |
| 37 | `geosim` | `geopolitics/cederman-2003-apsr-modeling-the-size-of-wars.pdf`; the 2002 PNAS predecessor; Clauset 2018/2019 tail-analysis follow-ups | 37 arms / 1,490 attempts retained: 1,486 complete, 4 invalid. Conditional source comparisons: 10 Unresolved, 1 Incompatible (75×75 grid); exact source equivalence remains Unresolved. Eight of 88 source targets available; all six technology/context contrasts Unresolved. Modern pooled iid checks: 15 reject, 5 do not reject, 2 inconclusive ([findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-geosim-findings.md), [provenance](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-geosim-provenance.json)); published ([publication receipt](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-geosim-publication.md)) |
| 38 | `democratic_peace` | `geopolitics/cederman-2001-jcr-democratic-peace-kantian-selection-process.pdf`; Cederman/Rao 2001 and Cederman/Gleditsch 2004 in [reading notes](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-democratic-peace-reading-notes.md) | Complete original-only census: 108 arms / 3,240 attempts, all complete, no invalid or missing keys. Precision not registered under the fixed runtime gate; all source scopes and six primary/six secondary contrasts Unresolved. 78 of 105 source slots readable; exact source equivalence Unresolved ([findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-democratic-peace-findings.md), [provenance](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-democratic-peace-provenance.json)); reviewed and published ([publication receipt](superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-democratic-peace-publication.md)) |

Milestone38 also has an approved [prospective precision/probability-reading follow-up](superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-democratic-peace-precision-design.md) and [separate preparation/export tooling](../survey/democratic_peace/FOLLOWUP.md). Its new10800literal and10800prose histories remain unmeasured and independently gated.

The preceding paragraph records prospective preparation. The separately dated
[2026-10-05 measured follow-up](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-democratic-peace-precision-findings.md)
contains all 21,600 new attempts, all complete, with no missing, pending, partial or
invalid histories. Literal and prose combined readable source scopes are
conditionally Incompatible; prose Figure 10 is Compatible only for its 15/33
readable slots. Literal primary/secondary mechanism aggregates are
Inconclusive/Fails; prose aggregates are Holds/Holds. Separate
[provenance](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-democratic-peace-precision-provenance.json),
[literal findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-democratic-peace-precision-literal-findings.json),
[prose findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-democratic-peace-precision-prose-findings.json),
and [figures](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-democratic-peace-precision-figures/plot-inventory.json)
retain the frozen scientific identity, extinction/undefined census and descriptive
reading sensitivity. This extends milestone 38 without revising its original
measured row; historical executable/RNG/statistic equivalence remains Unresolved.

Recovered GeoSim code stays reference-only: GeoSim0 declares GPL-2.0-or-later; the GROWLab framework declares LGPL-2.1-or-later; nested GeoSim2 headers leave model-specific licensing unresolved. No author model source was transplanted. See the [author provenance](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-geosim-author-code-reading-notes.md) and [artifact audit](superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-geosim-artifact-audit.md).

## Queue

In rough order: complete original-and-critique pairs first, then the large projects. Every entry is
worth doing; "size" is a guess at the milestone's scale.

Earlier:

- For Schelling's variations: van de Rijt, Siegel & Macy (2009), "Neighborhood chance and neighborhood change", *AJS* 114(4), with Bruch & Mare's reply, before any caption on continuous versus threshold preferences; and Schelling's *Micromotives and Macrobehavior* (1978), whose 8 × 8 reshuffled board Singh et al. critique.
- For ethnocentrism: Hammond & Axelrod, "Evolution of contingent altruism when cooperation is
  expensive", *Theoretical Population Biology* 69 (2006), 333–338, the model HA06 builds on, and the
  source of the blind-versus-seeing comparison at high cost that doesn't reproduce here (read it
  before any caption says HA06's 14 % is wrong).
- For the completed milestones' records: Epstein 2002 (civil violence), Janssen 2009 (Anasazi),
  Edmonds & Hales 2003 and Roberts & Sherratt 2002 (tags), Axtell, Axelrod, Epstein & Cohen 1996
  (docking), Lorenz 2006 (bounded confidence).


P4's [supplied caching-gesture protocol](superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-minds-deception-protocol.md)
has one complete accepted native campaign and byte-identical saved-data reanalysis, independently
empirically Approved in the [dated findings](superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-minds-deception-findings.md).
All 96×40 episodes, 64 primary and 64 separate secondary estimates remain; integration,
publication, remote verification and archival are [complete](studies/2026-10-08-minds-p4-publication-closure.md). False
observer estimates, diversion and owner economics remain distinct. Supplied ambiguous cues do not
expose hidden stock or sender policy, and Sham moves zero food. The unresolved 1998 citation trail
is a reading lead, not a confirmed reproduction failure or numerical animal target.
