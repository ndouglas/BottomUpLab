Episodes so far: the Sugarscape series, `sugarscape` (the pilot), `seasons`, `pollution`, `inheritance`, `tribes`,
`markets`, `war`, `credit`, `contagion` and `finale`; and the Cooperation series, `spatial`, `living`, `ethno`, `tags`, `image`, `norms`, `friends` and `stranger` (the finale); and Following the Crowd, `neighbors`, `tipping`, `variations`, `culture`, `opinions`, `agreement` ("How extremists win"), `thresholds` ("The riot that needs one person"), `ants` ("Ants at two food piles"), and `farol` ("Nobody goes, it's too crowded").

Shots run the Sugarscape, spatial games, the demographic PD, ethnocentrism, tags, image scoring, norms, El Farol or the minority game. A spatial shot's dump records each
generation's strategies, and its scores with `"scores": true`; `cells` gives a close-up a hand-made
board. A demographic-PD shot's dump records each cycle's agents, births (with the parent) and deaths,
and loads as a Sugarscape dump without sugar, so its crowd walks, clones and dies as the Sugarscape's
does (`colors: "strategy"`: blue helpers, red cheats). An ethnocentrism shot's dump records each
period's agents (their square, color, kind and founding newcomer); its board gets a Flump per square,
not per Flump (the land churns through hundreds of thousands), each in its color's yarn
(`colors: "tag"`) on felt in its kind's color. A tags shot's dump records each generation's list of
agents (with their parents) and, with `"gifts": true`, each gift; it loads as a `Ring`: a ring of felt
where each Flump stands at its tag's shade, twins crowding together, and a Flump leaps to its role
model's shade when its offspring copies another (`ring.py`). An image-scoring shot's dump records
each generation's agents (threshold, score, payoff) and, with `"gifts": true`, each meeting; it loads
as a `Street`: a column per threshold, each Flump in its score's yarn, the next generation taking its
places before its meetings play out one by one (`street.py`). A norms shot's dump records each
generation's agents (boldness, vengefulness, payoff) and, with `"gifts": true`, its cheats,
punishments and metapunishments; `"every": n` keeps every nth generation, so a million generations
fit a few hundred frames. It loads as a `Plane`: the boldness–vengefulness plane, a Flump per place
standing on its square (`plane.py`). A Schelling shot (his board, `schelling`, or his line, `line`) records each round's agents (square, color, content); it loads as a `Dump`, the line laid out as a row of squares, so the Flumps walk as the Sugarscape's do (`colors: "strategy"` draws Red and Blue); the `rings-unhappy` overlay rings the discontented. A tipping shot (Schelling's bounded neighborhood) records each step's insiders by rank; it loads as a `Dump` on `area.py`'s board — a fenced area between each color's queue, ordered by tolerance — so Flumps walk in and out; `fence` draws the area's fence and `tipplane` his plane (each color's tolerance curve and the path). A social-structure shot's dump records each period's agents (y, p,
q, payoff) and, with `"gifts": true`, each agent's partners; it loads as a `Grid`: a 16 × 16 block,
each Flump in its friendliness's shade, on its own square under the torus and in index order
otherwise, with yarn lines to a few followed Flumps' partners (`grid.py`).

A `farol` shot records each agent's actual choice, selected strategy and score before updating, forecasts or memory advice, pre-decision public history, and the resulting attendance. The episode uses 100 agents for the bar and 101 for the ordinary minority game; ensemble histograms summarize 20 bar seeds and 32 minority seeds. Its measured captions and selection protocol are retained in `episodes/farol/measurements.md`. The verified preview is `~/Movies/Flump Studio/sugarscape-027-farol.mp4` (960 × 540, 30 fps, 95 seconds), with one continuous original G-major schottische, *The Empty Chair*, at 103 BPM.

Needs Blender 5.2 at /Applications/Blender.app (or `BLENDER=/path/to/blender`), ffmpeg, and cargo.
Finished videos go to `~/Movies/Flump Studio/<episode>.mp4` (and `<episode>-preview.mp4`; set
`FLUMP_MOVIES` to change the folder). Working files go to `studio/out/<episode>/` (ignored by
git): `dumps/`, `beats/NN/` (PNG frames and the beat's `.blend`) and `music/`. The `.blend` files
open at the frame they were saved on; the animation is driven by a handler installed at render
time, so scrubbing them shows nothing.

Render times on an M1 Max (Blender 5.2, Eevee): the pilot's 19 beats (2,889 frames after dissolves,
96 s) took about 3 hours at final quality (1920 × 1080, 96 samples), and about 30 minutes as a
preview. The final encodes at CRF 21, so the pilot is 52 MB (Bluesky takes up to 100 MB).

## An episode

### Planning and presentation

These principles guide future storyboards and production, following the user's
October 4 review of the retirement episode. They are creative defaults, not fixed
duration or beat quotas. Apply them alongside each series' source and measurement rules.

- Build around one central idea, one complication, and a closing thought. Roughly
  90–100 seconds is a useful starting point; adjust the length to the subject.
  Prefer fewer, longer scenes when viewers need time to recognize and care about
  particular agents. Fourteen beats is not a target to fill.
- Let a small human moment open into a larger pattern. Follow recognizable
  individuals long enough for watching, hesitation, joining, companionship, or
  absence to matter. The characters personify the recorded behavior; their
  expressions must not imply motives, health effects, or outcomes the model cannot show.
- Give each moment one main sentence and one visual question. Avoid asking the
  viewer to read a caption, interpret a chart, follow characters, and absorb
  methodological details simultaneously. Use brief charts when they answer the
  current question, and protect both caption space and the characters.
- Keep qualifications that materially change the film's meaning on screen.
  Put detailed methods, sample sizes, selection protocols, and additional caveats
  in the linked measurements and source documentation. Simpler presentation must
  preserve scientific honesty and uncertainty.
- Preserve the handmade felt stage and original music as the series' shared
  identity. Let the tune carry emotional associations without captions naming
  every feeling. Include moments with no explanatory text while music and action
  continue; allow recognition to settle before the next explanation.
- Maintain continuity of recognizable identities, gaze, movement, and supporting
  graphics. Ease presentation changes while keeping recorded states and event
  times exact. Verify the transition itself, not only its endpoints. A necessary
  identity replacement should read as a departure and arrival.

During storyboard review, ask what idea the viewer will understand and what small
scene they will remember. During production review, check competing demands on
attention, reading time, character continuity, and breathing room in actual
composited frames and normal-speed playback. Geometry and decoded-frame checks
support this review but cannot establish its emotional effect.

`studio/episodes/<episode>/` holds:

- `shots/*.json` — the runs (`sugarscape shot`); everything a Flump does comes from one.
- `beats.py` — the beats: caption, length, shot, pacing, camera, overlays. Its docstring records
  what each shot does, read from its dump.
- `claims.py` — every captioned claim, measured over 20 seeds by `measure.py`, which writes
  `measurements.md` (and `measurements.json`, when panels show the medians). A caption is only
  rendered once its claim holds.
- `tune.py` — the episode's own tune (see below).

## Music

Each episode has its own tune, written in ABC notation in `tune.py` (a `music.Tune`: voices as
General MIDI instruments, 8-bar sections, the forms it may be played in, a tempo range, and stings
cued to beats). The build fits it to the cut — choosing a form and a tempo so it ends with the
video — renders it with abc2midi and FluidSynth, mixes in the stings where their beats begin, and
lays it under the video, faded in and out.

- If `episodes/<episode>/music.wav` (or `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.m4a`) exists, that file is used instead.
- Rendering needs `brew install fluid-synth abcmidi` and the FluidR3 GM SoundFont (MIT licence) at
  `~/Music/SoundFonts/FluidR3_GM.sf2` (or wherever `FLUMP_SOUNDFONT` points):

      curl -L -o ~/Music/SoundFonts/FluidR3_GM.sf2 --create-dirs \
        https://github.com/pianobooster/fluid-soundfont/releases/download/v3.1/FluidR3_GM.sf2

The tunes so far: the pilot's *Flumps' Walk*, a gånglåt in D (accordion, fiddle drone, guitar),
Seasons' *The Thaw*, a waltz in A minor after the Russian waltz (violin and pizzicato for
summer; celesta and sleigh bells in C major for winter), and Pollution's *Smoke over the Mill*, a
brass-band chorale in E♭ that sinks into C minor under a tolling bell, and Inheritance's *The
Ground Beneath*, a passacaglia in D minor whose cello ground repeats under every variation, and
Tribes' *Two Choirs*, a polychoral canzona with recorders on the left answering oboe and bassoon on
the right until they play as one, and Markets' *The Spice Rag*, a slow rag in F for honky-tonk piano,
banjo, tuba and clarinet, whose oom-pah walks between two notes as the Flumps walk between two
hills, with a D-minor clarinet strain and a B♭ trio, and War's *Poseidon's Horn*, an original 5/4
march in D minor on a triplet figure, building under a drone from timpani and snare to the full
march, until its horn sting — a chord swelling across the brass patches, choir and organ — ducks
the march beneath it on the last title (a tune's `ducks` sink it under a sting), and Credit's
*Borrowed Time*, a 7/4 blues in E: a walking bass over coin percussion, then the band with tenor
sax, and a ka-ching as the first loan is made, and Contagion's *Tarantella of the Well*, the
dance once believed to cure a spider's poison, brightening to A major as immune systems learn and
turning dark and driving for the plague, and the finale's *The Walk Home*, the pilot's gånglåt theme
passed two bars at a time between every episode's instruments, ending on a lone accordion; and
Spatial games' *Neighbors in Phase*, a phase piece after Reich's *Piano Phase*: marimba and
vibraphone on one twelve-note figure in D Dorian, the vibraphone slipping ahead an eighth at a time
until, when the Flumps move one at a time, it falls into triplets over a drone a half step down; and
Living neighbors' *A Round for Neighbors*, a round in G for flute, clarinet, oboe and bassoon, each
voice copying the tune as each clone copies its parent, until in the soup they crowd in a bar apart
in G minor and drop out, leaving a muted trumpet alone; and Ethnocentrism's *Cradle Song for Four
Colors*, a lullaby in F for music box, harp, clarinet and cello, one instrument per color, whose
phrases scatter to the wrong instruments when children are scattered, until the music box winds down;
and Tags' *The Twins' Slip Jig*, in 9/8 (a tune's `meter` line), played in unison by twin instruments,
up a step with each takeover, until the twins are forbidden and the fiddle falls a beat late; and
Reputation's *The Talk of the Town*, a Charleston in B♭ whose clarinet phrases a muted trumpet
repeats a bar later, as a reputation gets passed along, until the band drops out to a lone tuba; and
Norms' *A Fugue for Keeping Order*, a fugue in C minor for string quartet whose voices answer each
other while the norm holds and fray when it collapses.

To give a tune better instruments, drag `out/<episode>/music/<slug>.mid` into GarageBand (one track
per instrument), choose instruments, keep the tempo, and export the song as audio to
`episodes/<episode>/music.m4a`; then re-run the build with `--skip-render` to re-cut. `--no-music`
leaves the video silent.

Tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s studio/tests -t studio -v`
(`tests/fixtures/tiny.frames.json` is `sugarscape shot tests/fixtures/tiny.json`.) They check
every module, the Blender ones included, for names used but not defined, and that each episode's
beats, overlays, measurements and tune cues agree, without Blender.

Before a render, or after changing anything under `blender/`, run the smoke test:
`python3 studio/smoke.py [EPISODE ...]` renders one small still and caption of each kind of beat
from the episodes' real dumps (making any that are missing) and fails on any beat that can't be
built. Each episode takes a few seconds to a minute; stills go to `out/<episode>/smoke/`.

Overlays live in `blender/overlays/`: `parts.py` (anchors, text, cards), `followers.py` (things
that follow Flumps), `panels.py` (screen-space displays) and `caption.py`; a new overlay goes in
`BUILDERS` in `__init__.py`.

### Relative agreement

`agreement` records each agent's opinion and uncertainty, starting opinion, and initial
role. Its felt histogram spans −1 to +1. Starting-opinion yarn colors preserve identity;
cream marker lengths show current uncertainty. The opinion × time diagram retains true
simulation periods when shots sample every several periods. The pair explanation uses
actual initial opinions and uncertainty intervals, labeled as a rule example.

The episode's *The Certain Few* is an original D-minor piece in 6/8 for bassoon,
clarinet, marimba and cello. Its persistent outer figures spread into a flexible middle
phrase as the crowd changes. Caption rules and samples are in
`episodes/agreement/measurements.md`; source assumptions and reconstruction checks are
in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-agreement-spike.md`.

`thresholds` records each agent's exact threshold, participation, forced-seed flag,
crowd and actual neighbors, with the model's true step and completed-episode count.
One grid cell represents one real agent. Coral indicates participation and blue
indicates waiting; the neighborhood inset uses recorded edges. Outcome panels use
the measured ensemble, while example traces retain their own seed and actual steps.
The selected ceiling example shows steps 500–600 with a labeled 85–95% axis.

Its original A-minor tune, *The Missing Rung*, uses flute, vibraphone, pizzicato
strings and bassoon. Beat-aligned cues pass a rising phrase between voices or
remove its answer. Each cue hands off from the backing: it fades to silence during
0.8 seconds before the first cue note, stays silent through the full notated cue
and 0.3 seconds of release, then returns over 0.8 seconds as the cue fades out.
Deliberately missing entrances and sparse gaps remain in the score. Measurements and
fixed rules are in `episodes/thresholds/measurements.md`, and the source audit is
in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-thresholds-spike.md`.

Closing cards use `<title> - After <Names>, <Year>\nndouglas.github.io/BottomUpLab` (`episode.SITE_URL`)
above a single camera-facing agent. A no-shot beat named `end` with `caption_y=0.45`
uses the established composition and one late blink.

Individual threshold values appear in the two teaching close-ups; overview shots
use their distribution ruler and measured panels. Check text visibility through
every frame of the camera moves, plus the separate caption bounds, with:

```sh
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender -b --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -P studio/tests/blender_thresholds_layout.py
```

This regression uses the recorded dumps, actual font and projected scene bounds
to check clipping, unrelated panel occlusion and text intersections.


`ants` records each agent's actual source, independent status, counts, true model
clock, and sparse network edges. Optional event recording preserves the model's
random draws and records the actual recruitment partner or spontaneous switch.
Two identical food piles represent source choices; movement between them is
illustrative. Source colors and readouts use the same recorded frame. Yellow
agents and rings mark the actual independent agents.

The episode shows every agent in each filmed population. Panels distinguish
short filmed examples from the complete measured ensembles and exact stationary
predictions. The pairwise comparison holds total meetings fixed; the network
comparison uses sequential sweeps. Graphs in the independent-agent comparison
are separately generated. All outcomes, fixed rules, and horizons are retained
in `episodes/ants/measurements.json` and summarized in `measurements.md`.

Its original *The Turning Chain* is a Breton-inspired D-Dorian dance in 2/4
for oboe, clarinet, and a quiet accordion drone/pulse. Its instrumental replies
adapt the overlapping handoff of kan ha diskan: the answer enters before the
caller finishes, then carries alone. One continuous score carries these exchanges
at a single fitted tempo, with overlap limited to the caller’s final beat. The
independent passage retains a small steady D line. The closing
uses the established title, attribution, URL, and one late blink.

After generating the ants dumps, check all frames, captions, plotted geometry,
teaching markers, and the actual closing blink with:

```sh
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender -b --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -P studio/tests/blender_ants_layout.py
```
