"""Following the Crowd, episode 5: "Listening to the like-minded" (Hegselmann
& Krause 2002; Lorenz 2006).

A felt ruler: opinion 0 to 1 across 200 columns, a row per Flump ordered by
where it started, so the start reads as a diagonal; each period every Flump
hops to its new opinion's column, and camps stand in lines. Colors by start,
red at 0 to magenta at 1, as in their figures. The panel top right is their
own picture: opinion against period, a line per agent for a sample of 120.

What each shot does, each seed typical of 20 (see measurements.md):
middle — hk-polarisation (625, ε 0.15), seed 8: two camps (55 % and 45 %),
  still from period 9.
three — the same, seed 1: three camps (36 %, 35 % and 29 % in the middle),
  still from period 7.
few — hk-plurality (ε 0.01), seed 8: 37 opinions, still from period 9.
many — hk-consensus (ε 0.25), seed 8: one opinion, still from period 52.
edges — hk-regular-50 (50 evenly spaced, ε 0.2), seed 1: the ends move in
  first; two camps from period 8.
lean — confidence 0.2 to the right, 0.02 to the left, seed 10: one camp at
  0.94 by period 12.
extremes — 50 evenly spaced, ε 0.4, bias m = 1, seed 1: camps at both ends.
neighbors — a 25 × 25 torus, four neighbors, ε 0.2, seed 16, a frame every
  25 periods: 76 % in one camp and 81 stranded minorities (period 2,785).
small — 50 agents, ε 0.22, seed 1: two camps (66 % and 34 %).
