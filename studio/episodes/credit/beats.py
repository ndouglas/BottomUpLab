"""Episode 8, "Credit" (Animation IV-5; rule L₁₀,₁₀).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
Loan lines take the book's colors: green from pure lenders, yellow through red
from Flumps deeper in the debt ladder.

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
loan — a 10 × 10 flat board: an old Flump (62, past childbearing, 60 sugar)
  beside a young one (25, holding 5 of a 40-sugar endowment). In tick 1 the
  old Flump lends 10, due as 20 at tick 10 (the engine's reading of the rate:
  10 % simple interest a tick). They wander apart, to opposite edges by
  tick 6, and meet again: in tick 11 the young one repays (its sugar 35 → 29
  as it eats) and the old one's rises 70 → 84; in tick 12 it borrows again.
world — iv-5-credit, seed 17 (typical of 20): 51 loans by tick 20, about
  170–240 outstanding after; the debt ladder is usually 4–5 levels deep and
  reaches 10 at ticks 966–968.
