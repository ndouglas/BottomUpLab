"""Episode 6, "Markets" (Animations IV-1 to IV-6, Figure IV-13).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
Sugar is golden, spice red; with two goods the felt rises over both goods'
hills, sugar sitting a little west of a cell's center and spice a little east.

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
pantry — a 10 × 10 board, sugar in the south-west, spice in the north-east;
  one Flump at (4, 5) holding 20 sugar and 4 spice, needing 2 spice a tick,
  walks to the spice hill by tick 4, fills up (27 spice by tick 14) and
  turns back for sugar.
swap — a 6 × 6 board packed with Flumps in a checkerboard, 30 sugar and 3
  spice or the reverse; nobody can move, so neighbors trade: 101 pairs, 340
  exchanges at a median price of 1.0 in tick 1, and by tick 4 all are even
  and trading stops. The followed pair start in the middle.
shuttle — iv-1-spice, seed 18 (typical of 20 for walking): 28 % of the
  Flumps alive through ticks 100–200 change hills twice or more; 400 → 119
  by tick 1000, all by starvation.
walk — the same seed with trade on: 30 % shuttle (walks count between sites deep in each hill).
market — iv-3-trade, seed 19 (typical of 20 for the market): 355 exchanges
  in tick 1, 108 at tick 10, 12 at tick 500; the price stays near one while
  the spread falls from 0.47 (ticks 1–50) to 0.02 (950–1000).
