"""Cooperation, episode 7: "Friends and strangers" (Cohen, Riolo & Axelrod
2001).

The board is a 16 × 16 grid of Flumps colored by p, how readily each helps
after being helped (see grid.py): red wary, green friendly. On the torus
each stands on its own square, so its partners are next door; otherwise the
grid is just the agents in order. Yarn lines show six followed Flumps'
partners this period.

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims; each seed
typical of 20 for its structure's payoff):
intro — cra-2dk, seed 6, 3 periods.
strangers — cra-rwr, seed 20: mean payoff near 1.1 throughout.
neighbors — cra-2dk, seed 6: 2.46 by period 100, about 2.55 after.
friends — cra-frn, seed 15: 1.44 at 100, then about 2.5.
tenth — cra-ffr-01, seed 12: about 2.4 from period 100.
third — cra-ffr-03, seed 9: low to 300, high by 400, dipping at times.
half — cra-ffr-05, seed 5: about 2.2 to period 250, collapsed by 300.
