"""Cooperation, episode 3: "Ethnocentrism" (Hammond & Axelrod 2006; Jansson
2013).

Board coordinates: one unit per square, square (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5,
h/2 − y − 0.5); the land wraps around. A Flump's yarn is its color (its tag:
coral, teal, lilac or blue, colors="tag"); the felt under it, its kind:
amber helps only its own color, cream helps everyone, charcoal helps no one,
magenta helps only other colors.

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims):
closeup — 8 × 8, every square filled at random (seed 3), 4 periods.
land — ha-standard, seed 15 (typical of 20), to period 1,400: help-own-only
  70 % by period 800, 77 % at 1,380 (where "favor" ends: the 20-seed median).
scatter — ha-standard, seed 9 (typical of 20 for the scattering), with each
  child placed anywhere from period 1,000: help-no-one 7 % at 1,000, 47 % at
  1,200 and 88 % at 1,500; the land fills to about 2,250.
blind — ha-cost-2-blind, seed 2 (typical), 2,000 periods.
blind1 — ha-standard with color-blind Flumps (discrimination none), seed 20
  (typical of 20: 81.9 % help over periods 1,901–2,000), 2,000 periods.
