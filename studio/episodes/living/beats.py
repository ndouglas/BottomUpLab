"""Cooperation, episode 2: "Living neighbors" (Epstein 1998, the demographic
Prisoner's Dilemma).

Board coordinates: one unit per square, square (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5,
h/2 − y − 0.5); the board wraps around. Helpers are blue, cheats red
(colors="strategy"); a Flump's wealth stands in its dump's sugar.

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims):
closeup — 8 × 8, 14 Flumps, Run 1's rules, seed 45: in cycle 1, helpers 5
  and 14 clone themselves and cheat 4 goes broke. The followed Flumps are
  helper 14 and cheat 4 (focus 13 and 3: founders' ids start at 1).
land — dpd-run-1, seed 8 (typical of 20): the board is full by cycle 34;
  729 helpers to 171 cheats at cycle 500.
soup — dpd-soup, seed 10 (typical): the last helper is gone at cycle 8.
low — dpd-run-4 (R = 1), seed 18 (typical): nobody left at cycle 243.
