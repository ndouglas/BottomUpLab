"""Episode 3, "Pollution" (Animation II-8).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
On the 50 × 50 board the sugar hills sit around board (14, 14) and (−10, −10).

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
mess — a Flump grazing a small hill with pollution on: every site it gathers
  and eats on is stained, and the total climbs 0 → 6 → 11 → … → 41 in 8 ticks.
avoid — a heavy eater (eats 4) stains the rich hill (4, 6); at tick 6 a
  newcomer (sees 4) arrives at (8, 6), four cells from it and from a poorer,
  clean hill (12, 6). The rich site holds 4 sugar under 8 pollution (worth
  4 / 9); the clean one 3 (worth 3). It takes the clean hill.
world — ii-8-pollution, seed 6 (typical of 20): pollution from t = 50,
  diffusion from t = 100. The share on the hills falls from 91% (t = 49) to 36%
  by t = 60, and drifts back to 62% as diffusion spreads the soot everywhere.
clean — the same world and seed with its schedule removed: pollution never starts.
