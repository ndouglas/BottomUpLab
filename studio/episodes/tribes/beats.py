"""Episode 5, "Tribes" (Animations III-6/III-7).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
The book's two tribes: Blue when a Flump's eleven tags hold more zeros than
ones, else Red.

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
rub — a Blue Flump among three Reds on a small, sugar-rich board: its tags
  flip at ticks 2 and 7 (01001000100 → …), and at tick 10 it turns Red
  (01011001101). The influence runs both ways: a Red briefly turns Blue too.
world — iii-6-culture, seed 7 (typical of 20): 50/50 and mixed at the start
  (neighbors alike 56%); Blue holds 95% and both hills by tick 3000.
divided — seed 9: at tick 3000 the north-east hill is all Red, the
  south-west 99% Blue; the world splits 52/48.
calm — seed 7 with culture off, for the population comparison.
