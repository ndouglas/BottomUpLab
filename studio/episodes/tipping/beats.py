"""Following the Crowd, episode 2: "The tipping point" (Schelling 1971,
pp. 167–186; 1969).

The board (see area.py): a fenced area in the middle, Red's queue on the
left and Blue's on the right, each ordered by tolerance, the most tolerant
nearest the gate. Flumps walk in and out as the area changes; a warm ring
marks an insider about to leave. Schelling's plane rides top right: Red
inside across, Blue inside up, each color's tolerance curve, the path.

What each shot does (exact schedules, so each is one run; see
measurements.md): intro — Fig. 18, 4 steps. fig18 — from 25 and 25, Blue
leaves; all Red (100) by step 76. fig19 — from 50 and 50 to 80 and 80 by
step 31. entry — Fig. 19 from 100 Red and 28 Blue to 80 and 80 by step 53.
fig20 — from 60 and 40, all Red by step 42. cap — Red limited to 40, from 10
and 10 to 40 and 40 by step 31. lesstol — the least tolerant two-thirds of
Red intolerant: from 40 and 40 to 33 and 42 by step 8. allless — every Red
with a third the tolerance: from 40 and 40, all Red by step 61.
