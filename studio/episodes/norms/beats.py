"""Cooperation, episode 6: "Norms" (Axelrod 1986; Galán & Izquierdo 2005).

The board is the plane of temperaments (see plane.py): boldness from left to
right, vengefulness from front to back, each Flump on its square; Galán &
Izquierdo's "established" squares tinted green (back left), "collapsed" red
(front right).

What each shot does, all seed 2 (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims;
seed 2 is one of the 12 whose norm collapses under Galán & Izquierdo's tie
reading but holds under Axelrod's):
close, metaclose — the norms and metanorms games, 3 generations, with events.
normsrun — the norms game to generation 1,000: cheating falls at first, then
  the norm collapses by 500.
holds — metanorms to generation 100: established by 25, and held.
long — metanorms to 1,000,000 under Galán & Izquierdo's tie reading, every
  2,500th generation: established until about 290,000, then collapsed.
axel — the same under Axelrod's: established throughout.
mild — milder metapunishment to 10,000, every 25th: collapsed by 2,500.
