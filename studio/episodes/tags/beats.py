"""Cooperation, episode 4: "Tags" (Riolo, Cohen & Axelrod 2001; Edmonds &
Hales 2003).

The board is a ring (see ring.py): a Flump stands where its tag names, tags
running clockwise from 0 to 1 with a gap at the top, in that shade's yarn; twins crowd in a pile
outside the ring; a wheel of shades lies just inside it.

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims):
early — rca-published, seed 6, 8 generations, with gifts: generation 0 is
  100 random shades and tolerances.
long — rca-published, seed 6 (typical of 20), 3,400 generations: a crowd
  by generation 100; at 700–740 84–87 Flumps share tag 0.3523 (lower right,
  at (10.6, −9.2) on the ring), places 0, 1 and 3 with tolerances near 0.01; takeovers
  at generations 987, 1077, 1429, 1559, 1643, 2229, 2456, 2756 and 3330.
strict — rca-strict, seed 2 (typical): giving collapses by generation 50.
clones — eh-clones-only, seed 1 (typical): giving climbs to about 75 % by 75.
