"""Episode 2, "Seasons" (Animation II-7).

Wide shots look from the east, so the equator runs up the frame with the
north (+y) on the right. Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at
(x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5); the north is rows y < h // 2.

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
reprise — the pilot's patch: a lone Flump circling a small hill as it regrows.
regrow — two sites, one each side of the equator, from empty: the north's
  grows 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4, the south's 0.125 a tick.
walk — a far-sighted Flump (sees 6) in the winter south hops 4 cells north
  into summer and prospers (8 → 19 sugar).
wait — a frugal, short-sighted Flump (eats 1, sees 1) stays in the south
  through its winter, running down 8 → 3.5, and recovers to 7.8 when summer
  comes.
world — ii-7-seasons, seed 7 (typical of 20 seeds). The hungry (metabolism ≥ 3)
  alive at tick 53 die in a wave at ticks 55–64, just after winter reaches the
  north at tick 50; none survive (as in every seed).
calm — the same world and seed with seasons off.
