"""Episode 4, "Inheritance" (Animations III-1–III-4).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
family — a mother and father (placed side by side on a small hill, lifespan
  fixed at 30 for the close-up) have children at ticks 16, 18, 25 and 30, each
  starting with 6 sugar (half of each parent's starting endowment). At tick 32
  both die of old age, holding 47 and 51; their 98 sugar splits four ways, and
  the children jump 32 → 56, 25 → 48, 14 → 40 and 8 → 35. (Siblings may pair
  under rule S; a grandchild arrives at tick 32.)
family-plain — the same, without inheritance: identical until tick 32, when
  the parents' sugar vanishes and the children carry on as before.
heirs, plain — iii-4-inheritance and iii-2-sex (identical but for rule I),
  the same typical seed, 1000 ticks.
