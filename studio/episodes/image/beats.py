"""Cooperation, episode 5: "Reputation" (Nowak & Sigmund 1998, image
scoring).

The board is a street (see street.py): twelve columns, one per threshold k,
from "help everyone" (k = −5) on the left to "help no one" (k = +6) on the
right; each Flump stands in its threshold's column in the yarn of its score
(red −5, pale 0, green +5). Each tick, the next generation first takes its
places, then plays its meetings one by one.

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims):
early — ns-fig-1, seed 1, 6 generations, with meetings.
paper — ns-fig-1, seed 2: the discriminators (k = 0) have taken over by
  generation 65 (as in 5 of 20 worlds).
here — ns-fig-1, seed 10: a threshold that helps no one (k = +6) has taken
  over by generation 57 (as in 13 of 20; everyone helps in the other 7).
cycles — ns-fig-2 (mutation, 300 meetings a generation), seed 12 (typical of
  20): cooperation collapses at generation 12,065, recovers at 12,765 and
  collapses again at 13,048; the beat plays 11,800–13,400.
