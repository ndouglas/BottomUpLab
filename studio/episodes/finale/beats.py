"""Episode 10, "What didn't reproduce": the book's results that its stated
rules don't grow, over 20 seeds each.

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the numbers):
everything — vi-1-everything, seed 17: every rule at once; 400 → 117 by
  tick 100, 1,252 by 300.
without / with — vi-2-no-trade and vi-3-trade, seed 17 (typical of 20): both
  fall from 500 to about 110–170 by tick 100, pass 800 by 300 and track
  each other after (790 and 879 at tick 1000).
waves — ii-6-waves, seed 17: the book's full 20 × 20 block in the south-west
  corner; it spreads a little and stays.
collide — iii-12-collision, seed 17: opposed blocks in the corners; each tribe
  settles on its own hill and they never meet.
