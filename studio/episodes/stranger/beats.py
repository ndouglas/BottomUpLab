"""Cooperation, episode 8: "Why help a stranger?", the series finale.

Each montage shot is a copy of an earlier episode's shot (the same preset,
seed and length), so every Flump still comes from a real run of its model;
see those episodes' beats for what each run does. The ledgers' right-hand
column comes from measurements.json (see claims.py): the earlier episodes'
20-seed measurements, and Epstein's Run 4 measured here.

neighbors — Spatial games' scatter (nm-1b-chaos, 99 × 99, seed 11).
relatives — Ethnocentrism's land (ha-standard, seed 15).
look — Tags' long run (rca-published, seed 6).
name — Reputation's paper run (ns-fig-1, seed 2): everyone ends up helping.
rule — Norms' holds (ax-metanorms, seed 2): established by 25.
faces, strangers — Friends and strangers' fixed partners (cra-frn, seed 15)
  and strangers (cra-rwr, seed 20).
