"""Episode 9, "Contagion" (Animations V-1 to V-3; McNeill).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
Flumps turn sickly green while they carry a disease; infection lines are the
book's transmission network (Animation V-3).

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
Rule E follows the book: one immune flip per agent per tick (note 16), and a
disease learned this tick still passed on this tick (the worked example).

ward — an 8 × 8 flat board: seven neighbors, each carrying 1–3 diseases. In
  ticks 1–3 diseases pass round the cluster (seven infections); every one of
  them is well by tick 6.
rid — v-1-rid, seed 17 (typical of 20): 87% sick at tick 0, 2% by tick 8,
  none from tick 12 on.
endemic — v-2-endemic, seed 17: 25 diseases, 10 each; everyone sick at tick
  0, none from tick 15 on.
stranger — v-mcneill, seed 18 (typical of 20): no one sick by tick 299; the
  novel 10-bit disease given to 5 at tick 300 peaks at 22% at tick 302 and is
  gone by 310.
plague — the same seed with a 40-bit novel disease (our experiment): 53% sick
  by tick 305, 94% by 310.
