"""Following the Crowd, episode 3: "Variations on a theme" (Pancs & Vriend
2007; Gauvin, Vannimenus & Nadal 2009; Singh, Vainchtein & Weiss 2009;
Zhang 2004).

Schelling's felt board from episode 1 at each paper's own size, a Flump per
agent, Red or Blue (colors="strategy"); a card top left names whose rules
these are, a number top right the paper's own measure. Board coordinates:
one unit per square, square (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).

What each shot does, each seed typical of 20 (see measurements.md):
board — s71-board, seed 4 (episode 1's): still from round 5.
flat, p50 — pv-flat and pv-p50 (5 × 5, 20 Flumps), seed 1: two clusters by
  step 2 (a step is 20 turns); flat's Flumps keep moving among squares they
  like as well, the clusters stay.
ring — pv-ring (20 in a ring), seed 4: two groups by step 3.
gvnrule — gvn-segregated (50 × 50), seed 1, the first 4 steps: everyone moves
  every step. segregated — the same to step 1,000, a frame every 20: 64
  clusters at step 1, 4 at 100, 2 at 1,000 (s 1.00).
frozen — gvn-frozen, seed 13: 70 move in step 1, then nobody (79 % discontent).
mixed — gvn-mixed, seed 13: s about 0.05 throughout.
small — svw-small (8 × 8), seed 1: two clusters, still by step 3.
large — svw-large (100 × 100), seed 9: 57 clusters, still by step 9.
zhang — zhang-checkerboard (100 × 100, 10,000 Flumps), seed 15, 20 steps;
  sorts — the same to step 1,000, a frame every 25: 20,000 mixed pairs to
  about 2,000.
spiked — pv-spiked, seed 3: never settles, about as mixed as chance.
