"""Following the Crowd, episode 1: "Neighbors like me" (Schelling 1969, 1971).

Schelling's own models: his line (a row of 70 with no gaps) and his
checkerboard (13 × 16 with edges, 138 chips and 70 blanks). A Flump per agent,
Red (his stars) or Blue (his zeros) (colors="strategy"); a warm ring at the
feet of the discontented. Board coordinates: one unit per square, square
(x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).

What each shot does, each seed typical of 20 (see measurements.md):
line — s71-line, seed 1: 23 of 70 discontent; 20 move in round 1, 4 in
  round 2, 1 in round 3; still from round 4, in 7 groups.
board — s71-board, seed 4: 39 % discontent; 42 move in round 1, 13, 2, 1;
  still from round 5, 0.79 alike.
third — s71-third, seed 14: 18 move, then 2; still from round 3, 0.61 alike.
company — s71-congregate, seed 15: 56 move, then 4; 0.79 alike.
mixed — s71-integrate, seed 6: 38, 39, 16, 2 move; still from round 5 with
  9 % unsatisfied.
