"""Episode 7, "War" (Animations III-9 and III-11; rule C).

Board coordinates: one unit per cell, cell (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5, h/2 − y − 0.5).
Flumps wear their tribe's color: Blue starts on the south-west hill, Red on
the north-east.

What each shot does (from its dump; see measurements.md for the world beats):
fight — an 8 × 8 flat board: a Blue with 40 sugar at (3, 3), a Red with 3 at
  (3, 5). In tick 1 the Blue takes the Red's site and its 3 sugar.
wary — the same Blue with a poorer Red at (3, 4), in reach, and a richer Red
  (60) at (3, 6), which would see the Blue on the poor Red's site. Nobody
  moves and nobody attacks in the first ticks; without the richer Red, the
  Blue kills the poor Red in tick 1 (checked).
conquest — iii-9-combat, seed 14 (the war starts at tick 618, the median
  is 591): a first kill at tick 95, then quiet. Blue Flump 63 makes its first
  kill at tick 605 and its tenth by 620; its sugar goes from 625 at tick 600
  to 53,842 at 700; Red has 59 Flumps at 700, 17 at 800, none after 1009.
  It makes 117 of the 124 kills.
standoff — seed 7: 11 kills in 2000 ticks; both tribes keep their hills.
endless — iii-11-combat-fixed, seed 1: both tribes held at 200; 4,564 kills
  in 500 ticks, spread over every quarter of the board (21–30 % each).
