"""Cooperation, episode 1: "Spatial games" (Nowak & May 1992; Huberman &
Glance 1993; Nowak, Bonhoeffer & May 1994).

Board coordinates: one unit per square, square (x, y) at (x − w/2 + 0.5,
h/2 − y − 0.5). Helpers are blue, cheats red; the felt under a Flump that
just switched glows green (turned helper) or yellow (turned cheat).

What each shot does (see measurements.md for the 20-seed claims):
board — a hand-made 7 × 7 board, b = 1.9, fixed edges: a block of cheats in
  the top right and bottom left. In generation 1, 10 helpers turn cheat and
  3 cheats turn helper.
kaleidoscope — nm-3-kaleidoscope: one cheat at the center of 99 × 99; the
  pattern is four-fold symmetric every generation and reaches the edges at
  t = 49 (the same in every seed).
scatter — 99 × 99, 10 % cheats at random, b = 1.9, seed 11 (typical of 20):
  helpers settle near 32 %.
tempt — the same at b = 1.77, seed 8 (typical): about 75 % help.
clock — hg-async-kaleidoscope, one Flump at a time, seed 17 (typical): no
  helper left at t = 97.
below — nbm-continuous on 99 × 99: 50 % cheats, periodic edges, b = 1.71,
  one at a time, seed 8 (typical): about 72 % help.
